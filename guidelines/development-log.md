- **Cursor Rules**: Comprehensive rules covering business logic, multi-project management, template generation, security, and AI interaction patterns
- **Business Context**: Rules designed specifically for a holding company management system that generates project templates

### ✅ MongoDB Multi-Cluster Support (Recent)
**Description**: Refactored MongoDB utility to allow multiple Atlas clusters via `MONGODB_CLUSTERS` env variable and added cluster selection to Create-App flow.

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `lib/mongodb.ts` – Refactored to parse JSON cluster map, cache client promises per cluster, and expose `getDatabase(clusterKey, dbName)`.
- `app/create-app/page.tsx` – Added target cluster select field and validation.
- `app/api/create-app/route.ts` – Accepts `targetCluster` and validates it.

**Architecture Details**:
- **Environment Variable**: `MONGODB_CLUSTERS` holds a JSON object mapping cluster keys (e.g. `"geoff-vrijmoet-com"`) to connection strings that omit the database segment. Falls back to legacy `MONGODB_URI`.
- **Connection Pooling**: Shared Map caches `MongoClient` promises per base URI enabling reuse across clusters.
- **Create-App Flow**: Frontend lets user choose the desired cluster; API receives `targetCluster` for future deployment orchestration.

### ✅ Web App Generator UI Enhancements (Recent)
**Description**: Implemented auto-fill GitHub repo name and updated Project Name placeholder.

**Files Modified**:
- `app/create-app/page.tsx` – Added dynamic cluster fetch, auto GitHub repo generation, placeholder update.
- `app/api/clusters/route.ts` – New endpoint returning available cluster keys.

**Architecture Details**:
- On mount, create-app page fetches `/api/clusters` to populate cluster list dynamically from `MONGODB_CLUSTERS`.
- GitHub repository field auto-populates based on sanitized Project Name until user edits repo field manually.

### ✅ Template Suggestions System
**Description**: Implemented a complete system for collecting and displaying suggestions from other web applications.

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `lib/models/TemplateSuggestion.ts` - Data model interfaces
- `lib/mongodb.ts` - MongoDB connection utility

- `components/TemplateSuggestions.tsx` - React component for displaying suggestions
- `app/page.tsx` - Added suggestions component to main page
- `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete API documentation

**Architecture Details**:
- **MongoDB Collection**: `template_suggestions` in `next-shadcn-template` database
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/suggestions` (POST for submit, GET for fetch)
- **Data Flow**: External apps → POST API → MongoDB → GET API → React component → UI
- **Key Features**: Filtering, pagination, priority badges, code examples, responsive design

### ✅ Services Selection Hierarchy (Recent)
**Description**: Reworked services section with nested Google sub-services, removed Uploadthing & Vercel Analytics, added Cloudflare Video.

**Files Modified**:
- `app/create-app/page.tsx` – Introduced hierarchical services list, parent/child selection logic.

**Architecture Details**:
- Parent "Google" checkbox selects/deselects all underlying Google APIs children.
- Features stored as flat strings array in form state; helper functions manage nested toggling.

### ✅ AI Cursor Rules Generation (Recent)
**Description**: Integrated OpenAI (o3) to auto-generate Cursor rules from project description on Create-App page.

**Files Added/Modified**:
- `app/api/generate-cursor-rules/route.ts` – Server route calling OpenAI chat completion and returning cleaned rules.
- `app/create-app/page.tsx` – Debounced description watcher, fetches generated rules, shows preview card.
- `package.json` – Added `openai` dependency.

**Architecture Details**:
- Requires `OPENAI_SECRET_KEY` env variable (already set).
- Uses `gpt-4o-mini` model with custom system prompt, returns 5-10 bullet rules.
- Rules are displayed for user review; future step can store them into guidelines.

### ✅ GitHub Repository Integration (Latest)
**Description**: Added full GitHub repository creation step to the Web App Generator deployment pipeline. The API now creates a private repo via GitHub PAT, stores deployment records in MongoDB, and updates progress tracking.

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/create-app/route.ts` – Implemented GitHub repository creation, MongoDB deployment tracking, step updates, and error handling.

**Architecture Details**:
- **Deployment Orchestration**: `create-app` endpoint now records deployments in the `deployments` collection and executes the GitHub step immediately.
- **GitHub Service**: Utilises existing `GitHubService` to create repos for the authenticated user.
- **Progress Tracking**: Each deployment stores step metadata (`pending` → `in-progress` → `completed`).
- **Error Handling**: Failures update the deployment record with `status: failed` and error details.

```

### 🗄️ Database Architecture

**MongoDB Database**: `next-shadcn-template`

**Collections**:
- `template_suggestions`: Stores suggestions from external applications
  - Fields: title, description, category, submitterName, submitterUrl, codeExample, implementationNotes, priority, status, tags, createdAt, updatedAt
  - Indexes: Recommended on `status`, `category`, `createdAt` for performance

### 🔌 API Architecture

**Base URL**: `/api/`

**Endpoints**:
1. **POST /api/suggestions**
   - Purpose: Accept suggestions from external web apps
   - Authentication: None (public endpoint)
   - Rate Limiting: Not implemented (consider adding)
   - Validation: Required fields checked server-side

2. **GET /api/suggestions**
   - Purpose: Fetch suggestions with filtering/pagination
   - Query Parameters: status, category, limit, skip
   - Response: Paginated results with metadata

### 🎨 Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router  
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS  
**UI Components**: shadcn/ui  
**State Management**: React useState (local state)  
**Authentication**: Clerk (configured but not used for suggestions)

**Key Components**:
- `TemplateSuggestions`: Main component for displaying suggestions
  - Features: Filtering, loading states, responsive grid, code examples
  - Data fetching: Client-side with useEffect
  - Styling: Tailwind with responsive design

### 🔧 Development Patterns

**File Naming**: 
- Components: PascalCase (`TemplateSuggestions.tsx`)
- API routes: lowercase (`route.ts`)
- Utilities: camelCase (`mongodb.ts`)

**TypeScript Usage**:
- Strict typing enabled
- Interfaces in `/lib/models/`
- Proper error handling with try/catch

**Error Handling**:
- API: HTTP status codes with descriptive error messages
- Frontend: Console errors, loading states, empty states

### 🚀 Deployment Considerations

**Environment Variables Required**:
- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string
- Other Clerk variables for authentication (if used)

**Database Initialization**:
- Collections are created automatically on first document insert
- No migrations required for current schema

### 🔍 How to Find and Modify Features

**To find suggestion-related code**:
```bash
# Search for collection usage
grep -r "template_suggestions" .

# Search for API endpoints
find . -path "*/api/*" -name "*.ts"

# Search for suggestion components
find . -name "*Suggestion*"
```

**To modify the suggestions system**:
1. **Data Model**: Edit `lib/models/TemplateSuggestion.ts`
2. **API Logic**: Edit `app/api/suggestions/route.ts`
3. **UI Display**: Edit `components/TemplateSuggestions.tsx`
4. **Database**: Update MongoDB queries as needed

**To add new features**:
1. Define TypeScript interfaces in `/lib/models/`
2. Create API routes in `/app/api/`
3. Build React components in `/components/`
4. Update this development log with architecture details

### 📝 Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow ESLint rules (fix linter errors before committing)
- Use Tailwind for styling (avoid custom CSS)
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading and empty states for user interactions
- Use semantic HTML and accessibility features

### 🔄 Maintenance Tasks

**Regular Updates Needed**:
- Monitor API usage and add rate limiting if needed
- Consider adding authentication for admin features
- Add database indexes as collection grows
- Update dependencies regularly

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
- Implement caching for suggestion data
- Add loading skeletons for better UX
- Consider server-side rendering for initial suggestions
